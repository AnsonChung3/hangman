            Anything you put in this component will be seen in any of the subcomponents

            There are times you would want something else in this component
            For example, you might want to have a toolbar available on all of your pages
            Or you might want to have a thing that pulls out from the sides (a drawer)
            Those would go here and then be seen on any of the pages underneath /Anson/
